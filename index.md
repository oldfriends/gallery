Old Friends Computer Rescue is an organization dedicated to the restoration and care of older, unused computers. We keep our computers healthy and occupied, letting them fully enjoy their hobbies in a peaceful, safe environment.â€‹Our current residents are:

* NeXTstation (moving in)
* Raspberry Pi 1
* iPhone 4 (moving in)
* Nexus 5 (moving in)

Please take a look at our residents' [posts about their hobbies and activities]({{ "/posts" | relative_url}}). They love to share what they're up to!

We're always happy to take on new residents! If your old computer needs a new home, please tell them about Old Friends!
